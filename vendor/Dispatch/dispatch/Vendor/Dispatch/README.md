# DISPATCH 5.x

Dispatch is a PHP micro-framework. It has just enough PHP for getting small
apps up and running quickly.

## Requirements

* php 5.4
* php-xdebug (for running complete tests)

## Running Tests

Dispatch makes use of ad hoc tests using PHP's `assert()` function. Run the
following command to run them.

```
php tests/dispatch-tests.php
```

If you don't have `php-xdebug` installed, some of the tests will be skipped
(specifically, the header tests).

## Short Example

```php
<?php
require __DIR__.'/dispatch.php';

# handle specific error codes
map([400, 404, 500], function ($code) {

  $code = intval($code);

  switch ($code) {

  case 404:
    echo "Page not found";
    break;

  case 400:
    echo "Bad request";
    break;

  default:
    echo "Internal server error";
    break;
  }
});

# hook for transforming value for {uid}
hook('uid', function ($uid, $db) {
  $uid = strtolower(trim($uid));
  return isset($db[$uid]) ? $db[$uid] : null;
});

# map route handler for any method
map('/users/{uid}', function ($args, $db) {

  # $args['uid'] has the db row (from the hook) or null
  if ($row = $args['uid'])
    return print "user: {$row[0]}, {$row[1]}, {$row[2]}\n";

  # trigger our 404 handler
  return error(404);
});

# arguments to dispatch() gets forwarded too
dispatch($db = [
  'u01' => ['anna', 28, 'f'],
  'u02' => ['rein', 33, 'f'],
  'u03' => ['john', 27, 'm'],
  'u04' => ['tina', 31, 'f'],
  'u05' => ['alex', 36, 'm']
]);
```

## Changes from 4.x to 5.x

Below is a comprehensive list of changes from Dispatch 4.x to 5.x. For
complete information, please read the rest of this document.

* `error()` no longer maps error handlers, just triggers http errors
* `config()` replaced with `settings()`
* `flash()` removed
* `html()` replaced with `ent()`, directly maps to `htmlentities()`
* `params()` removed, replaced by `array` argument for routes symbols
* `cookie()` renamed to `cookies()`, better maps to `setcookie()`
* `request_headers()` merged into `headers()`
* `is_xhr()` removed
* `request_body()` replaced by `input()`
* `files()` replaced by `attachments()`
* `send()` removed
* `scope()` removed
* `redirect()` 3rd argument no longer a condition, but a halt flag
* `content()` removed
* `template()` removed
* `render()` removed
* `inline()` removed
* `partial()` replaced by `phtml()`
* `nocache()` now requires parameter for the content
* `json()` no longer supports the `$func` parameter
* `filter()` and `bind()` removed, replaced by `hook()`
* `before()` removed
* `after()` removed
* `on()` renamed to `map()`, and changes in behavior
* `dispatch()` changed to no longer accept method and URI

All in all, apps written in 4.x will no longer work in 5.x.

## API Documentation

### Mapping Route and Error Handlers

Create routes using the `map()` function. The following are valid
examples.

```php
# standard route -- a method, a path, an action
map('GET', '/index', 'index_action');

# multiple methods on a path
map(['GET', 'POST'], '/index', 'index_action');

# any method against a path
map('/index', 'index_action');

# action for any method and path
map('catch_all_action');

# multiple paths against an action
map(['/index', '/about'], 'index_action');

# route symbols are placed into $args
map('GET', '/greet/{name}', function ($args) {});
```

Error handlers can be created with `map()` as well. Call it with
two arguments -- an array of codes, or a single code, and the callable.

```php
# single code against a routine
map(404, 'not_found');

# multiple codes against a routine
map([401, 402, 403], 'request_error');
```

### Route Symbol Hooks

Route symbols can have hooks that modify their value during dispatch.
These hooks can be created with `hook()`.

```php
# call when matching route has the url_id symbol
hook('url_id', function ($url_id) {
  # what we return is used as the new value
  return md5($url_id);
});

# route that triggers the url_id hook
map('GET', '/urls/{url_id}', function ($args) {
  # the value for url_id has been updated by our hook
  $url_id = $args['url_id'];
  print("{$url_id} is the md5() of the original \$url_id");
});
```

### Triggering HTTP Errors

To trigger an http error code and execute any mapped error handlers, return
`error()` from within your action, passing to it the http error code
you want to trip, along with whatever parameters you want to pass.

```php
# example 404 error handler
map(404, function () {

  $argv = func_get_args();
  $code = array_shift($argv);

  # $argv now has all other args other than the http code
});

# route handler that triggers a 404
map('/not-found', function ($di) {

  # let's trip the 404 handler, and pass the $di var
  return error(404, $di);
});

# our fake di container is just an array, passed during dispatch
dispatch($di = array());
```

### Dispatching and Dependency Passing

Once you have your actions and error handlers in place, you can serve the
current request via `dispatch()`.

```php
# basic dispatch
dispatch();

# dispatch with dependencies passed around
dispatch($arg1, $arg2, ...$argN);
```

DISPATCH allows you to pass dependencies to your route handlers, error
handlers, and hooks. To pass a dependency, use it as an argument to
`dispatch()`.

For actions/route handlers, if the route has symbol values, the `$args`
hash get injected first, then the arguments from `dispatch()` get passed
next.

```php
# route has a symbol, so we get $parmas first, then the dispatch() args
map('GET', '/greet/{name}', function ($args, $config) {
  # ...
});

# ex. we have a config object as a dependency
$config = parse_ini_file('config.ini');

# pass it along
dispatch($config);
```

For symbol hooks, you will get the symbol value as first argument, then
the injected dependencies next.

```php
# sample hook that gets the value first, then the injected ones
hook('name', function ($name, $config, $db) {
  # ...
});

# sample config dependency
$config = parse_ini_file('config.ini');

# sample db dependency
$db = db_connect($config);

# pass dependencies around
dispatch($config, $db);
```

For error handlers, we get the error code first, then the injected args
next.

```php
# we get the http error code first, then the injected ones
hook(404, function ($code, $db) {
  # ...
});

# ex. we have a db connection
$db = db_connect();

# pass along the db
dispatch($db);
```

Note that the order in which the dependencies are passed around is the
same as when they were passed to `dispatch()`. You can also choose to
ignore these arguments from the right, as php allows it.

### Redirects

Redirect headers can be sent via the `redirect()` function. This
function only sends out the HTTP headers and doesn't stop your script from
executing, but has the option to behave like so.

```php
# just dump the headers with a custom code
redirect('/index', 302);

# or send the headers and halt the execution
redirect('/index', 302, $halt = true);
```

### Cookies, Session, Files, and Headers

To access values from `$_COOKIE`, `$_SESSION`, `$_FILES`, and the request
headers, you can do so with `cookies()`, `session()`,
`attachments()`, and `headers()`, respectively. If the value
is not present, you'll get a `null` back.

```php
# get a cookie
$name = cookies('name');

# get a session var
$name = session('name');

# get a header (header keys are converted to lowercase)
$type = headers('content-type');
```

For file uploads, DISPATCH will re-organize and group together the file
attributes if the file matching the name is an array.

```php
# get an uploaded file
$file = files('photo');
```

For setting values, you also use the same functions but with extra
parameters for the values (and other options).

For `cookies()`, the arguments map directly to PHP's `setcookie()`
function. For `session()`, it's just the variable name and the
value.

```php
# set a cookie value that expires after a year
cookies('name', 'noodlehaus', time() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, '/');

# set a session var
session('name', 'noodlehaus');
```

For `headers()`, it's a bit similar to PHP's `header()` function,
the difference is it doesn't allow non-key-value pair headers (ie.
`HTTP/1.0 200 Ok`), and the key and the value need to be passed separately.

```php
# set a response header
headers('content-type', 'text/html');

# set a header and use the rest of header()'s options
headers('location', '/index', $replace = true, $code = 301);
```

### Raw Request Body

If you need the raw data for a request (ie. for `PUT` requests), you can
use `input()` to either get the file containing the data, or to
receive the data contents (for small sizes). This returns an array in the
`[content-type, path_or_data]` structure.

```php
# receive the type and the contents
list($type, $data) = input($load = true);

# receive the type and path to the file
list($type, $path) = input($load = false);
```

When getting the data directly, be sure to keep the data size in mind.

### Caching and JSON Responses

Use `json()` to send out JSON responses. This encodes the
object the object you pass to it, and prints out the appropriate headers
for the response.

If you want the client NOT to cache this response (or any response), you
can wrap it with `nocache()`, and it will print the appropriate
expires headers for you.

```php
# print out JSON data
json(['name' => 'noodlehaus']);

# print out JSON and don't let them cache it
nocache(json(['name' => 'noodlehaus']));
```

### Views and Helpers

To render PHP-based template files, use `phtml()`. This accepts
a filename, and hash that will be `extract()`ed into the template's scope.

```php
# load the template
$page = phtml('views/index.php', ['name' => 'noodlehaus']);
```

In forms, we usually have the need to pre-populate a set of fields safely
by doing calls to `isset()`. For this, you can use `blanks()` to
create a hash of blanks for your form values.

```php
# create a hash of empty strings with the following keys
$fields = blanks('name', 'email', 'username');
```

Functions `ent()` and `url()` are available as shortcuts to commonly-used
template functions `htmlentities()` and `urlencode()`. The arguments to these
functions map directly to the arguments of their target PHP functions.

```php
$encoded = ent('Tom & Jerry', ENT_COMPAT, 'utf-8');
$urlsafe = url('/redirect/target');
```

### Client IP

To get the remote IP address, use `ip()`.

```php
$ip = ip();
```

### PHP Configuration Files

To load `.ini` or `.php` configuration files, load and access their
contents using the `settings()` function.

To load a settings file, specify a filename as an argument prefixed by
the `@` symbol. Everytime `settings()` is called this way, all new values
are merged in using PHP's `array_replace_recursive()`.

```php
# initialize settings store
settings('@config.ini');
```

When using `.php` files, the file must return either an `array` or a
callable that returns one.

```php
# example array config
return [
  'app.hostname' => 'localhost',
  'app.environment' => 'development'
];
```
```php
# example callable config
return function () {
  return [
    'app.hostname' => 'localhost',
    'app.environment' => 'development'
  ];
};
```
